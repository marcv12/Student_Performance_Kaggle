# Analyzing students grades according to their behaviour with SPSS


This project was part of my final project for Brainnest Data analysis apprenticeship

The chosen dataset taken from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/larsen0966/student-performance-data-sets) shows how students perform on their exam and contains the following variables: Sex, Age, Parental status (whether they are married or divorced), study time, number of failures, and finally the grade they got on the exam.  
I have conducted a thorough univariate and bivariate analysis of the dataset using SPSS and you will gain a lot of statistical analysis tools through this project and gain insightful knowledge of what influences students' grades.  
I provide the link to my **report**: [Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rpyyhFgjB0iYYYHar9CUZfl45cEYi7Cx/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=116688624539339004078&rtpof=true&sd=true)
